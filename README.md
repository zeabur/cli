# Zeabur CLI

[Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/)'s official command line tool

> Note: Zeabur CLI is currently in beta, and we are still working on it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.

## How cool it is

1. Manage your Zeabur resources with CLI
2. Login with browser or token
3. Intuitive and easy to use
4. The design of the context makes it easier for you to manage services.
5. The seamless integration of interactive and non-interactive modes.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

* Linux/macOS: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeabur/cli/main/hack/install.sh | sh`
* Windows: go to [release page](https://github.com/zeabur/cli/releases) to download the latest version.

(TIP: you can put the binary file in the PATH environment variable to use it conveniently.)

### 2. Login

If you can open the browser:
```shell
./zeabur auth login
```

Or you can use token to login:
```shell
./zeabur auth login --token <your-token>
```

Zeabur CLI will open a browser window and ask you to login with your Zeabur account.

### 3. Manage your resources(Interactive mode, recommended)

```shell
# list all projects
./zeabur project ls

# set project context, the following commands will use this project context
# you can use arrow keys to select the project
./zeabur context set project

# list all services in the project
./zeabur service ls

# set service context(optional)
./zeabur context set service

# set environment context(optional)
./zeabur context set env

# restart the service
./zeabur service restart

# get the latest deployment info
./zeabur deployment get

# get the latest deployment log(runtime)
./zeabur deployment log -t=runtime

# get the latest deployment log(build)
./zeabur deployment log -t=build
```

### 4. Manage your resources(Non-interactive mode)

Non-interactive mode is useful when you want to use Zeabur CLI in a script(such as CI/CD pipeline, etc.)

Note: you can add `-i=false` to all commands to disable interactive mode. 
**In fact, if the parameters are complete, it's same whether you use interactive mode or not.**

```shell
# list all projects
./zeabur project ls -i=false

# set project context, the following commands will use this project context
./zeabur context set project --name <project-name>
# or you can use project id
# ./zeabur context set project --id <project-id>

# list all services in the project
./zeabur service ls

# set service context(optional)
./zeabur context set service --name <service-name>
# or you can use service id
# ./zeabur context set service --id <service-id>

# set environment context(optional)(only --id is supported)
./zeabur context set env --id <env-id>

# restart the service
# if service context is set, you can omit the service name; so does environment context
./zeabur service restart --env-id <env-id> --service-name <service-name>
# or you can use service id
# ./zeabur service restart --env-id <env-id> --service-id <service-id>

# get the latest deployment info(if contexts are set, you can omit the parameters)
./zeabur deployment get --env-id <env-id> --service-name <service-name>
# or you can use service id
# ./zeabur deployment get --env-id <env-id> --service-id <service-id>

# get the latest deployment log(runtime)(service id is also supported)
./zeabur deployment log -t=runtime --env-id <env-id> --service-name <service-name>
# get the latest deployment log(build)(service id is also supported)
./zeabur deployment log -t=build --env-id <env-id> --service-name <service-name>
```
